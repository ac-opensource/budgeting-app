# AGENTS Instructions

These guidelines apply to the entire repository.

- **Commit Messages**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages.
- **Changelog**: Add entries to `CHANGELOG.md` under the current version heading. Do not use an `Unreleased` section.
- **Versioning**: Bump the project's semantic version numbers in each PR. Choose a minor or patch increment as appropriate and reset the patch when increasing the minor version.
- **Nested Instructions**: Check for additional `AGENTS.md` files in subdirectories when modifying files within them.
